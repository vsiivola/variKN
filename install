Building the varikn toolkit requires the CMake tool.  CMake is a
makefile generator (like Autoconf). The build script is in
CMakeLists.txt.  
    
The convention for CMake is to build "out-of-source", where all the
work is done in a separate directory from your source directory.
First, we configure the build (we only need to do this once): 

  mkdir build 
  cd build 
  cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release 

Useful tricks: 
* By default, the makefiles generated by cmake are 'quiet'. To make
  them verbose (so you can see what's being passed to gcc, etc) use 
  the VERBOSE variable like this: make VERBOSE=1

* You can make a debug build with

  cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

* If you're experimenting with alternate build flags, you can define 
  them as environment variables before configuring.  For example:
   
  cd build
  export CXXFLAGS=-fmudflap
  cmake ..
  make

* If you are reconfiguring cmake with very different settings (for 
  example, switching from Debug to Release), you should start in a 
  new build folder or delete everything in your current build folder.

* CMake also supports generating IDE project files (MSVC, XCode, 
  etc). To get a list of what it supports, do "cmake -h".  For 
  example, to create an MSVC project:
  
  mkdir .build
  cd .build
  cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 9 2008"
  start Project.sln

  or to create an XCode project:

  mkdir .build
  cd .build
  cmake .. -G Xcode
  open Project.xcodeproj

* Note on Eclipse CDT.  Eclipse is finicky about the way its 
  projects are laid out.  Instead of creating a "build" folder as 
  a child of your source dir you'll need to create it as a *sibling*.
  You'll also need to tell cmake to link the build dir to the source 
  dir in the Eclipse project. (See http://tinyurl.com/28zuhqb for 
  more information.)  For example:

  cd trunk
  mkdir ../.build-trunk
  cd ../.build-trunk
  cmake ../trunk/ -G "Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles" -DECLIPSE_CDT4_GENERATE_SOURCE_PROJECT=TRUE

  Then in Eclipse you'll do File->Import the project in .trunk-build.  
  Inside this project you'll see a link to "[Source Directory]".

* Language wrappers DLLs can be built for Python using Swig.  
  These are built automatically if the languages are detected by
  cmake. You can explicitly enable/disable building for these
  wrappers by passing -DPYTHON=1 (-DPYTHON=0). On Mac OS X, you can 
  force the python version to macports with -DMACPORTS_PYTHON_VERSION=2.6 .
  Python 3 has various levels of support in different versions of cmake, 
  see the comments in python-wrapper/CMakelists.txt.

TEST:

Building Unit tests can be enabled with "-DCMAKE_ENABLE_TESTING=1". The tests 
do not work on Windows yet. Unit tests can be run with "make test" or 
"ctest --verbose". Unit tests require the unit test library from Boost.
